# GameJam2023

- Conway's game of life
    - start with 3 levels and if those are too easy then make 5
    - first level can be super easy intro
    - maybe limit screen to 8x10 or something?
        - wrap edges?
    - goal is to get to certain state based on inital
        - somehow prevent the player from just starting with the goal position
        - maybe limit starting area and make full game larger?
